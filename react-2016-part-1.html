## What is React?

---

class: center, middle

### What is React?

.center-content[
* React is an open-source JS library for creating user interfaces that aims to
address the problems of building large applications with data that changes over
time.

* Originally developed at Facebook, it is now used at Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb,
and HelloSign.

* It only cares about creating components that encapsulate behavior and state

* It’s simple, declarative, composable, and fast

]

## How is React different?

---

class: center, middle

### How is React different?

.center-content[
* Forces you to think in terms of small components

* Clear seperation between state and static properties

* Extremely simple yet powerful API

* Easy to debug

* Fast and low memory footprint

* Works well with third-party libraries

* Works well with existing codebases

* To put it simply: it's like a declarative jQuery

## Lesson 1: Write Components, Not Templates

---

class: center, middle

### "State is the root of all evil."

-Abraham Lincoln

---

class: center, middle

### Lesson 1: Write Components, Not Templates

.center-content[
* MVC in the browser obscures the state of your application

* Client-side applications aren't a collection of models, views, and
controllers. They're a collection of UI components

* Markup and display logic are both concerned with rendering the UI. Therefore,
they belong together.

### A Simple React Component

```javascript
import React    from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1 className="header">Hello, World!</h1>
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

---

class: center, middle

### Do Not Fear JSX: It's Just JavaScript Under the Hood

```javascript
<h1 className="header">Hello, World!</h1>

// same as:

React.createElement('h1', {className: 'header'}, 'Hello, World!');
```
---

class: center, middle

### React components are highly reusable

```javascript

import React      from 'react';
import ReactDOM   from 'react-dom';
import HelloWorld from './hello-world';

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>
      <HelloWorld />
      <h2>React All The Things!</h2>
    </div>
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## Lesson 2: The Virtual DOM

---

class: center, middle

### Lesson 2: The Virtual DOM

.center-content[
* Not to be confused with the Shadow DOM

* A virtual representation of the currrent state of the DOM

* Reconciliation: When your data changes, React will perform a diff between the
new virtual DOM and the old virtual DOM, and figure out the fastest way to
update the real DOM

* Batches all changes via `requestAnimationFrame()` so updates are performed in
one browser paint

## Data in React

---

class: center, middle

### Data in React

.center-content[
* React separates data that changes over time (state) from immutable data that stays the same

* React calls these concepts “state” and “props”

* Components manage their own state

* Data can only flow from parent container to child container as props
]

## Live Example

## Diff Algorithm

---

class: center, middle

### Diff Algorithm

.center-content[
* React doesn't exactly re-render the whole app on every state change: it only changes the parts that need to change

* DOM is just a tree of nodes

* Comparing two trees is one of the most studied and understood problems in computer science

* Even with the most efficient algorithms, Finding the minimum number of mutations between two trees is a O(n^3) problem, where `n` is the number of nodes

* The fastest algorithms are not good enough: If two trees have 1,000 nodes each, figuring out the minimum operations to transform one to the other would require ONE BILLION operations

## How Does React Make it Fast?

---
class: center, middle

### How Does React Make it Fast?

.center-content[
React uses a set of heuristics to make its diff algorithm much more efficient:

1. Components of the same class will generate similar trees

2. Components of a different class will generate different trees

3. You can add unique keys to elements that are stable across different renders
]

## Event Delegation

---
class: center, middle

### Event Delegation

.center-content[
* Adding event listeners is notoriously slow.

* Since React triggers a re-render of a component and it's children on every state change, this can be a problem.

* React handles this by implementing a technique called "event delegation" which it calls “synthetic events”
]

---
class: center, middle

### Synthetic Events

.center-content[
* Instead of adding event listeners directly to a DOM node, React attaches only one event listener on the root of the document.

* React keeps a hash map off all the event listeners

* When an event is fired, the unhandled event bubbles up the DOM until it reaches React's single event listener.

* Once the event reaches React's synthetic event system, it looks up the DOM node the event is being called on in the hash map of events
]

---
class: center, middle

### Synthetic Events

.center-content[
* React's event system is W3C compliant, meaning that it will work on IE8

* It also means you have the same interface as the browser's native events, like “stopProgation()” and “preventDefault()”. You should keep this in mind if you're submitting a form:
]

---
class: center, middle

```javascript
class NewCatForm extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const catName = this.refs.catName.value.trim()
    ...
  }
  render() {
    return <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref="catName">
      <input type="submit">
    </form>
  }
}
```

## Three Flavors of React Components


---
class: center, middle

### Three Flavors of React Components

.center-content[
* ES2015 Classes

* ES5 `React.createClass()`

* Stateless Functional Components
]

---
class: center, middle

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1 className="header">Hello, World!</h1>
  }
}
```

---
class: center, middle

```javascript
import React from 'react';

var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <h1 className="header">Hello, World!</h1>
  }
});
```

---
class: center, middle

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld = (props) => {
  return <h1 className="header">Hello, World!</h1>
}
```

## JSX Gotchas

---
class: center, middle

### JSX Gotchas

.center-content[
* It looks like HTML but it's JavaScript

* `className` rather than `class`

* Inline styles are objects not strings

* Because the diff algorithm depends on comparing trees, JSX must have just one parent node.

* HTML Entities won't work: you need to use unicode. `\u00b7` > "middot"
