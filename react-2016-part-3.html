## What is Redux?

### What is Redux?

.center-content[
* Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps.

* Designed with React in mind, but can be used with any rendering library

* Excellent developer experience

* Like React, it works on the client, server, and native environments

* Ability to rewind your state aka time travelling

* Extremely small (around 300 lines of code)
]

### The Gist


```javascript
import {createStore} from 'redux'

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
  case 'INCREMENT':
    return state + 1
  case 'DECREMENT':
    return state - 1
  default:
    return state
  }
};

let store = createStore(counterReducer);

store.subscribe(() =>
  console.log(store.getState())
);

store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }) // 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }) // 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' }) // 1
store.getState() // 1
```

## Three Redux Principles

---

class: center, middle

### Principle 1: A Single Source of Truth

.center-content[
* The state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

* This makes it easy to serialize and send it over the wire.

* Fewer moving parts means easier to debug.
]

---
class: center, middle

### `getState()`: the entire state of your application

```javascript
console.log(store.getState());

/* Prints
{
  info: {
    "Ship Name": "USS Enterprise"
  },
  speed: 9,
  position: [0, 0]
}
*/
```
---
class: center, middle

### Principle 2: State is read-only

.center-content[
* The only way to mutate state is to emit an action.

* Actions are an object that describe what happened.

* This ensures no other actors can write directly to state
]
---
class: center, middle

### Use `dispatch()` to emit an action describing what happened.

```javascript
store.dispatch({
  type: 'UPDATE_DESTINATION',
  payload: {
    newDestination: 'Sol'
  }
});

store.dispatch({
  type: 'ENGAGE_WARP_DRIVE'
});
```
---
class: center, middle

### Principle 3: Changes are made with pure functions

.center-content[
* To specify how the state is transformed by actions, use reducers

* Reducers is a pure function with no side effects

* Reducers take the current state and an action, then return the next state

* You can start with a single reducer but then you want to break them apart to
deal with specific parts of the state tree
]
---
class: center, middle

### Use a case statement to respond to different actions

```javascript
function shipReducer(state = initialShipData, action) {

  const payload = action.payload;

  switch (action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE_DESTINATION':
      return updateDestination(state, payload.newDestination);
    case 'UPDATE_SPEED':
      return updateSpeed(state, payload.newSpeed);
    case 'UPDATE_POSITION':
      return updatePosition(state, payload.newPosition)
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

...

const store = createStore(shipReducer);
```
---
class: center, middle

### Reducers reduce

.center-content[
* Given a collection of past actions, you can reduce that collection into the current state.

* That is why these functions are called reducers: It's basically a reduce callback
]

```javascript
const actions = [
  {type: 'SET_INITIAL_STATE', payload: {info: {'Ship Name': 'USS Enterprise'}}},
  {type: 'UPDATE_SPEED', payload: {newSpeed: 9}},
  {type: 'UPDATE_DESTINATION', payload: {newDestination: 'Deep Space Nine'}},
  {type: 'UPDATE_SHIP_NAME', payload: {'Ship Name': 'USS Defiant'}}
];

const finalState = actions.reduce(reducer, Map())
```

### A Word About Actions

.center-content[
* There is a standard for actions called the "Flux Standard Action" or FSA

* This makes it easier to work with actions if you can always make certain assumptions
]

---
class: center, middle


### A basic FSA

```javascript
{
  type: 'SET_WARP_FACTOR',
  payload: {
    speed: 9.5
  }
}
```
---
class: center, middle


### An error FSA

```javascript
{
  type: 'GET_POSTS',
  payload: new Error(),
  error: true
}
```
---
class: center, middle


### FSA Rules
.center-content[
An action MUST

* be a plain JavaScript object.
* have a `type` property.

An action MAY

* have a `error` property.
* have a `payload` property.
* have a `meta` property.
]

## Cool story ... how does this work with React?
